## Brief Explanation

- Choose a pivot
- Every number greater than it should go on its right
- Recursively call QuickSort on the adjacent 'blocks' until the array is fully sorted

There are different way of implementing the algorithm just like to moving the Pivot. In this project I used the Lomuto Partition Scheme.
